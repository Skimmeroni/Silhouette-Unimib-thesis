abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.}

abstract="Silhouette index is commonly used in cluster analysis for finding the optimal number of clusters, as well as for final clustering validation and evaluation as a synthetic indicator allowing to measure the general quality of clustering (relative compactness and separability of clusters---see Walesiak and Gatnar in Statystyczna analiza danych z wykorzystaniem programu R. PWN, Warszawa, p. 420, 2009). Its advantage is low computational complexity and simple interpretation rules. Recently, some proposals have appeared to use this index directly as basis of clustering algorithms. The paper is a tryout of the evaluation of such approach. In the paper examples, when the ``mechanical'' use of the silhouette index leads to the results that do not correspond to the actual structure of the classes are shown, the recommendations on the principles of the correct application of the index are presented.",

abstract = { Quality indices in clustering are used not only to assess the quality of the partitions but also to determine the number of clusters in the final result. When these indices are evaluated in a case study, real data conditions or different clustering algorithms are seldom taken into account. Here, some of the standard indices used in the literature are compared using more realistic databases that include outliers or noisy dimensions, which is more like a real problem-solving approach. Besides, three different clustering methods are used in an attempt to identify different behaviours. Also, the performance of the quality index-clustering algorithm tandem is compared to random grouping, with the aim of running an additional check. The indices are ranked, and index-based conclusions are drawn for all the scenarios. }

abstract = {In K-Means based clustering algorithms, different initial seeds can lead to different clustering results. Selecting the best result from different initial seeds is called the filtering process. The filtering process follows three steps, 1- performing several clustering trials, 2- scoring each trial, and 3- choosing the trial with the best score. A typical method to score the clustering results of K-Means is the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). There are more advanced methods that can be used to score the clustering trials. These methods usually provide a better score with the cost of being more computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose Condensed Silhouette, which is a very efficient version of the Silhouette algorithm. For this purpose, we replace the elements of Silhouette algorithm with similar elements of the K-Means algorithm. This helps us to maintain the accuracy of the Silhouette and at the same time, significantly reduce the computational requirements of the method. Our experiments on 14 real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract="This article provides the performance evaluation of the Silhouette index, which is based on the so called silhouette width. However, the index can be calculated in two ways, and so, the first approach uses the mean of the mean silhouettes through all the clusters. On the other hand, the second one is realized by averaging the silhouettes over the whole data set. These various approaches of the index have significant influence on indicating the proper number of clusters in a data set. To study the performance of the index, as the underlying clustering algorithms, two popular hierarchical methods were applied, that is, the complete-linkage and the single-linkage algorithm. These methods have been used for artificial and real-life data sets, and the results confirm very good performances of the index and they also allow to choose the best approach.",
